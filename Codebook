This data set is modified from the original data set titled "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0"(Soure:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation are extracted and variable names are modified to be as discriptive as possible. 


The variables for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyccelerometer-XYZ and timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude.  

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ
timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ
timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ
timeBodyGyroscope-XYZ
timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ
timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ
frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude

The set of variables are available for these signals: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Values are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

There are two additional variables:

subject: subject ID ranging from 1 to 30
activity:name of the activities performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
